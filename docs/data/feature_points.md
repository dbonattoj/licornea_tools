# Feature points

A _feature points_ file contains the feature point for one view of an [image correspondences set](image_correspondences.html). Each feature point contains a pixel position, and optionally a depth and a weight. The _feature points_ are indexes by their feature name.

The _feature points_ file also contains the index of the view, and whether the view (image) was distorted.
