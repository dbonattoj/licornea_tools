# View homography

A _view homography_ file contains a 3x3 homography matrix to apply to an image. A _view homographies_ file contains a _view homography_ for each view index in a [dataset](data/dataset.html).

The homography matrix is a projective transformation in homogeneous coordinates, which maps pixel positions of the image to a new position.
